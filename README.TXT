Project: Quiz 1, Intro To Java 
Authors: Rodnie Rutterbush

Write a java program in BlueJ that contains one class. The class should be in a package called QuizOne.
Ensure that its state includes three fields. One field should be of a primitive type that accepts whole
numbers which will hold a person’s age, another should be a primitive type that accepts decimal
numbers which will be the cost of a book purchase, and the last field should be a class reference (object)
type that will be a person’s last name. Ensure the behavior of the class includes mutator and accessor
methods for each field. Each mutator method signature must include a formal parameter that initializes
its field to the parameterized value. Write a constructor that initializes each field to a default starting
value. Write a worker method that contains a variable that is locally-scoped and is assigned a tax
amount. Allow the variable to be added to the cost field, increasing it by the resultant amount. Include
JavaDoc for the class, constructor, and each method. Include a single-line comment in the worker
method describing the local variable
